[![Available in the Chrome Web Store](./chrome_badge.png)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/music-mode-for-youtube/abbpaepbpakcpipajigmlpnhlnbennna) [![Get the Add-on](./firefox_badge.webp)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/music-mode-for-youtube/)
## Overview
Music Mode for YouTube™ is a browser extension that hides the video and thumbnails on **YouTube**, **YouTube Music** and embedded YouTube videos in third-party sites. The extension used to block the video and play only the audio, but due to recent YouTube changes, it now only blocks videos on YouTube Music, while on YouTube, they are just hidden. It is compatible with **Chrome**, **Firefox** and most of the modern Chromium browsers. The extension:
- Hides the video on YouTube and blocks the video, playing only the audio on YouTube Music
- Hides the thumbnails of the videos
- Skips the ads 
- Hides the user avatars 
- Disables the "Video paused. Continue watching?" message

Music Mode for YouTube™ is highly customizable since all the features are optional and can be turned on/off separately for YouTube, YouTube Music and embedded YouTube videos.
Moreover, the extension can be enabled globally, for specific tabs, or temporarily for just a single video.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to recent changes on YouTube, it's no longer possible to separate audio from video, so the video cannot be blocked anymore. However, the extension still works on YouTube Music, allowing you to block video and save bandwidth. We are trying to find ways to block the video again. Any help is appreciated!

### Mobile support
The extension is fully compatible with YouTube for mobiles. The extension can be installed in a smartphone using **[Kiwi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)**, a Chromium browser for mobiles that supports extensions from the Chrome Web Store, or the Firefox browser for the Firefox version of the extension.
